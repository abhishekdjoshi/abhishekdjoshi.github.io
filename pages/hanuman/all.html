      <h2>Learn about Lord Hanuman</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Who is Lord Hanuman? </b><br />
        Lord Hanuman is believed to be a god under Hinduism. He is believed to
        be a divine Vanara (a combination of 'Vana', meaning forest, and 'Nara',
        meaning animal, thus considered as forest-dwelling animal. In the modern
        world, Vanaras are depicted as monkeys). Lord Hanuman is also a supreme
        companion and devotee of Lord Rama, and both are central characters of
        Hindu epic Ramayana. In addition to being an ardent devotee of Lord
        Rama, Lord Hanuman is also believed to be one of the seven immortals per
        Hindu scriptures. It is also believed that Lord Hanuman is an avatar or
        incarnation of Lord Shiva, and is also believed to be son of the Lord
        Vayu, the god of wind.
        <br /><br />
        According to scriptures, Lord Hanuman was born to Anjana, an angel who
        was cursed to earth, and father Kesari, a money king. Lord Hanuman is
        also called Vayu-Putra, the son of the Lord Vayu, the god of wind,
        because of Lord Vayu's role in Hanuman's birth. It is believed that when
        Anjana was worshiping, the King Dasharatha of Ayodhya was also
        performing the ritual in order to have children. As a result, he
        received some sacred pudding (payasam) to be shared by his three wives,
        leading to the births of Lord Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna.
        By divine ordinance, a kite snatched a fragment of that pudding and
        dropped it while flying over the forest where Anjana was engaged in
        worship. The wind god, Lord Vayu, delivered the falling pudding to the
        outstretched hands of Anjana, who consumed it. Hanuman was born to her
        as a result. <br /><br />
        Lord Hanuman is called Hanuman because of his disfigured jaw. In
        Sanskrit, 'Hanu' means jaw and 'Mana' means disfigured. According to
        scriptures, once up on a time in his childhood, Hanuman was hungry and
        saw the rising red colored sun. Mistaking it for a ripe fruit, he leapt
        up to eat it. Lord Indra, the king of gods, intervened and struck
        Hanuman with his thunderbolt. It hit Hanuman on his jaw, and he fell to
        the earth and got his jaw disfigured.
        <br /><br />

        <b>14 Attributes of Lord Hanuman </b><br />
        <b>1. Immortal (also Chiranjeevi):</b> Per the famous Hindu scripture
        Ramayana, it is believed that just before Lord Rama and Lakshmana die,
        Lord Hanuman is blessed to be immortal, and be a part of humanity
        forever. <br />

        <b>2. Celibate and Self-Controlled (also Brahmachari):</b> Lord Hanuman
        is one who controls lust from all materialistic things of this world.
        <br />

        <b
          >3. Ugly on the Outside (Kurup) and Beautiful in the Inside (Sundar):
        </b>
        In the scriptures, Lord Hanuman is described as ugly on the outside, but
        divinely beautiful in the inside. Lod Hanuman is believed to be the one
        with golden heart, full of devotion, love, compassion, strength and
        intelligence.<br />

        <b>4. Shape Shifter (Kama Rupen):</b> Lord Hanuman has the power to
        shapeshift, become smaller than the smallest, larger than the largest
        adversary at will. Lord Hamuman uses this power to shrink and enter
        Lanka, as he searches for the kidnapped Sita imprisoned by Ravana. Later
        on, he takes on the size of a mountain, blazing with radiance, to show
        his true power to Sita.<br />

        <b>5. Strength:</b> Lord Hanuman is extraordinarily strong, one capable
        of lifting and carrying any burden for a cause. He is called by many
        names such as Veer, Mahaveer and Mahabali Mahavira, Mahabala and others
        signifying his strength. During the epic war between Lord Rama and
        Ravana, Lord Hanuman leaps on mountains to find the particular herb to
        save the life of Lakshmana. On leaping the mountain, Lord Hanuman finds
        the mountain is full of many herbs and he doesn't know which herb to
        pick. So, Lord Hanuman lifts the entire Himalayan mountain and carries
        it across India to Lanka for Lakshmana. His immense strength thus helps
        Lakshmana recover from his wound. <br />

        <b>6. Innovative:</b> Lord Hanuman is described as someone who
        constantly faces tough situations and ambiguous challenges, where the
        adversary or circumstances threaten his mission with defeat and his very
        existence. Yet Lord Hanuman finds an innovative way to turn the odds.
        For example, when Lord Hanuman is arrested and tortured by Ravana's
        soldiers, and his tail is put on fire, Lord Hanuman leaps from one
        building to another building and burning the whole Lanka down in doing
        so. <br />

        <b>7. Devotion (also Bhakti): </b> Lord Hanuman is presented as the
        exemplary devotee of Lord Rama and Sita. <br />

        <b>8. Learned Doyen: </b> Lord Hanuman is believed to be an expert in
        Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism and the Vedas. Lord Hanuman is also
        believed to be a poet, a polymath, a grammarian, a singer and a musician
        par excellence.[47][1]<br />

        <b>9. Remover of Obstacles:</b> Lord Hanuman is believed to be the
        remover of all difficulties. <br />

        <b>10. Bestower of Power (also Siddhis) and Treasures (also Nidhis):</b>
        Lord Hanuman is described as the bestower of eight classical powers (the
        ability to become smaller than the smallest, reducing one's body to the
        size of an atom or even become invisible, the ability to become
        infinitely large, expanding one's body to an infinitely large size, the
        ability to become weightless or lighter than air, the ability to
        instantaneously travel or be anywhere at will, the ability to achieve or
        realize whatever one desires, the ability to control nature and
        organisms and establish supremacy over nature and ability to force
        influence upon anyone, the ability to control all material elements or
        natural forces, the ability to satisfy and suppress desire or make
        wishes come true) and nine treasures (lake double the size of padma in
        Himalaya with minerals and jewels, lake in Himalaya with minerals and
        jewels, conch shell, black antimony, tortoise or turtle shell, cinnabar
        or quicksilver, arsenic, antimony, cups or vessels baked in fire) - this
        was a boon granted to him by Sita. <br />

        <b>11. Healer of Diseases, Pains and Sorrows:</b> Lord Hanuman is

        Kulantaka, Lanke Neebhanjana, Simhi Kaprana Bhanjana, Maha Ravana
        Mardana, Kalanemi Pramathana. <br />

        <b>10 Amazing Facts about Lord Hanuman </b><br />
        <b>1. </b> Lord Hanumand once applied sindoor all over his body for Lord
        Rama’s long life. Lord Hanuman was greatly devoted to Lord Rama. A
        particular incident was when Sita put sindoor on her forehead, Hanuman
        asked her why. To this, she replied that since she is the wife and
        companion of Lord Rama, the sindoor was a sign of her unconditional love
        and respect. Hanuman then covered his entire body with sindoor to prove
        his love for Lord Rama. Lord Rama was really impressed by this and
        granted a boon that those who worshiped Lord Hanuman in the future with
        sindoor would see all their difficulties go away.<br />

        <b>2. </b>Although he was a brahmchari, Lord Hanuman had a son -
        Makardhwaja. Lord Hanuman’s son Makardhwaja was born to a mighty fish of
        the same name when Lord Hanuman after burning the entire Lanka with his
        tail had dipped in the sea to cool off his body. It is said that Lord
        Hanuman's sweat was swallowed by the fish and thus Makardhwaja was
        conceived.
        <br />

        <b>3. </b>Once, Lord Rama issued a death sentence to Lord Hanuman. After
        Lord Rama became the king, once, when the court was adjourned, Narada –
        known for creating disharmony between Lord Rama and Lord Hanuman – asked
        Lord Hanuman to greet all the sages except Sage Vishwamitra, since he
        was a king once. Lord Hanuman did so, but it did not affect Sage
        Vishwamitra. Narada went on and instigated Sage Vishwamitra, which
        angered him so much that he went to Lord Rama and asked him to punish
        Hanuman to death. Sage Vishmamitra being his guru, Lord Rama could not
        ignore his command and punished Lord Hanuman to death by arrows. Next
        day in the field, the statement was to be executed, but all arrows
        failed to do any harm to Lord Hanuman as he kept chanting Lord Rama's
        name. Since Lord Ram had to abide by his guru’s word, he decided to use
        the Brahmastra. To the surprise of all, Hanuman’s chants of Ram even
        failed the most powerful Brahmastra. Seeing this, Narada went to Sage
        Vishwamitra and confessed his mistake, stopping the ordeal. <br />

        <b> 4. </b> Lord Hanuman and Bhima were both brothers. Bhima was also
        the son of Vayu (the Lord of the Winds). One day, when Bhima was
        searching for a flower his wife wanted, he saw a monkey sleeping with
        his tail crossing the path. He asked him to move his tail. But the
        monkey didn’t do it and asked Bhima to move it. Bhima was very arrogant
        with his strength. Nevertheless, he couldn’t move or lift the tail.
        Therefore, he realized that this was not a mere ordinary monkey. It was
        none other than Lord Hanuman. He lied there just to reduce the arrogance
        of Bhima. <br />

        <b> 5. </b> When Lord Rama’s time of death was at hand, Lord Hanuman
        barred Yama from claiming him. When Lord Rama decided to leave his
        earthly existence for his journey to Vaikuntha (heavenly abode of Lord
        Vishnu), he knew that Lord Hanuman would not let him do so as he was a
        great devotee. So he instructed Lord Hanuman to find his ring which had
        fallen on the ground and then disappeared in the Patal Loka. Lord
        Hanuman went on the task of finding the ring and was met by the Yama. He
        told him that the falling of the ring signified that the time for the
        end of Lord Ram's avatar had come. <br />

        <b> 6. </b> Lord Hanuman once rejected Goddess Sita's gift. When Goddess
        Sita gave Lord Hanuman a beautiful pearl necklace as a gift he politely
        declined it saying he doesn’t accept anything that is devoid of Lord
        Rama’s name. To prove his point, the ardent devotee then ripped off his
        chest to reveal an image of both of them. <br />

        <b> 7. </b> Lord Hanuman has 108 names. <br />

        <b> 8. </b> Hanuman’s hunger saga. Once Lord Hanuman visited Goddess
        Sita in Sage Valmiki’s cottage and expressed his desire to eat some food
        cooked by Goddess Sita, who started cooking many dishes and started
        serving Lord Hanuman. But Lord Hanuman’s hunger was unquenchable and the
        entire rations of the house were coming to an end and finally Goddess
        Sita had to pray Lord Rama. Then Lord Hanuman suggested Goddess Sita
        serve a morsel with a tulsi leaf and then his hunger was finally
        satisfied. <br />

        <b> 9. </b> Lord Hanuman was kind of a naughty kid in his childhood and
        he often used to tease the meditating sages in the forests. Finding Lord
        Hanuman’s unbearable acts, but realizing that he was but a child, the
        sages placed a mild curse on him by which he became unable to remember
        his own ability unless reminded by another person. The curse of the
        sages is featured in Kishkindha Kanda and Sundara Kanda when Jambavantha
        reminds Lord Hanuman of his abilities and encourages him to go and find
        Goddess Sita. <br />

        <b>10.</b> After the birth of Lord Hanuman, Lord Varun blessed Lord
        Hanuman with a boon that he would always be protected from water. Lord
        Agni blessed him saying, “Fire will never burn you.” Lord Surya blessed
        him with two siddhis of yoga to help Lord Hanuman attain the smallest
        form and the biggest form at will. Lord Vayu showered Lord Hanuman with
        more speed than the speed of himself, the wind. Lord Yama (the God of
        Death) blessed him with a healthy life. <br /><br />

        <b>Where was Lord Hanuman born? </b><br />
        It is believed that the birthplace of Lord Hanuman is Kishkinda, which
        is near Hampi, in Gangavathi taluk, Koppal district, Karnataka state in
        India.<br /><br />

        <b>Why do followers believe in Lord Hanuman? </b><br />
        Lord Hanuman is symbol of strength and energy. Lord Hanuman is
        worshipped for his unyielding devotion to Lord Rama and is remembered
        for his selfless dedication to the Lord Rama. Lord Hanuman is considered
        the living embodiment of the Karma Yogi (one whose meditation and
        devotion are demonstrated through hard work or service). In return for
        his unconditional love, Lord Rama granted him everlasting life. He
        promised that he would be worshipped alongside Lord Rama and that his
        idol would be placed next to his. <br /><br />

        Followers also believe in Lord Hanuman for his ideal qualities: <br />
        <b>1. </b>Lord Hanuman was a scholar par excellence.He knew all the nine
        vyakaranas.(grammatical works in Sanskrit)<br />
        <b>2. </b>Lord Hanuman had immense strength.<br />
        <b>3. </b>Lord Hanuman had immense popularity among Vaanaras and all his
        opponents were fearful of him due to his fame.<br />
        <b>4. </b>Lord Hanuman was extremely courageous. His courage took him to
        Lanka after his travel across the ocean and his fearlessness startled
        Ravan himself.<br />
        <b>5. </b>Lord Hanuman was extremely fit and agile at the same time.
        Laziness was never his quality due to his ever ready nature.<br />
        <b>6. </b>Lord Hanuman was eloquent and purposeful. His speech soothed
        Goddess Sita in captivity. His speech defied Ravana and warned Ravana of
        the impending consequences of his behaviour towards Lord Rama.<br />
        <br />

        <b>What are the benefits of worshipping Lord Hanuman? </b><br />
        It is believed that by worshipping Lord Hanuman, one is provided with
        strength, both physical and mental and knowledge and all the pains,
        troubles, imperfections and impurities are removed. Lord Hanuman also
        protects from evil effects and evil spirits. <br /><br />
        It is believed that worshipping Hanuman helps one stay disciplined,
        achieve greater heights in life and career. Prayers to Lord Hanuman also
        help one overcome bad habits like cheating, adultery, laziness, fickle
        mindedness, procrastination etc. It brings in confidence and stable
        mind. It is also believed that if one is affected by Shani dosha then
        praying to Lord Hanuman is beneficial. <br /><br />

        <b>Which day of the week is Lord Hanuman worhsipped? </b><br />
        Most people pray to Lord Hanuman either on Tuesdays or Saturdays either
        by visiting Hanuman temples or at home and can also chant Hanuman
        Chalisa every day to get his blessings. <br /><br />
        Devotees worship Lord Hanuman on Saturdays to ward off the ill-effects
        of Lord Shani. And there's a story associated with this belief. Ravana,
        the demon-king of Lanka, had become so powerful that he could control
        the movements of the planets as per his will. During the time of his son
        Meghnad's birth, Ravana wanted his natal chart to be so dominant that he
        could remain invincible all his life. However, Lord Shani, who plays a
        vital role in shaping people's lives, played a trick when Ravana moved
        him on the birth chart. Hence, to punish Lord Shani, Ravana held him
        captive in a dark prison and hung him upside down. Subsequently, when
        Lord Hanuman visited Lanka in search of Goddess Sita, Lord Hanuman heard
        the faintly voice of Lord Shani, crying for help. Lord Hanuman stepped
        forward to help and rescued Lord Shani from the clutches of Ravana.
        Therefore, to thank Lord Hanuman for his humble gesture and return the
        favour, Lord Shani promised that he would never cast his effects on him.
        He also said that those who would worship Lord Hanuman on Saturdays
        would be relieved of his adverse effects.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Which festivals in celebration of Lord Hanuman? </b><br />
        <b>Hanuman Jayanti </b> is celebrated to commemorate the birth of Lord
        Hanuman who is also considered to be one of the incarnations of Lord
        Shiva. On this day, Hanuman Chalisa - a set of prayers glorifying Lord
        Hanuman - is recited. Depending on the devotee, the text is either
        recited non-stop for 24 hours or sometimes it's performed a set number
        of times. Special Pujas are performed and offerings are made to Lord
        Hanuman. Some people have different rituals, such as sacred fire
        ceremonies. In some places, especially in India, colourful processions
        fill the streets. People dance, carry idols of Lord Hanuman and some
        people wear masks and tails to imitate Lord Hanuman. Every celebration
        is always accompanied by a period of fasting and then a big feast.
